Number of operations - 2
1. modify-overwrite-beta
2. shift

Explaintion -
Here we have to concat the values of first name and last name.
And add the city and zip in the outer map.
So I have used modify-overwrite-beta to concat values of first & last name and given its name as fullName.
Then I have used another shift operation to select only required key value pair in the expect format.
