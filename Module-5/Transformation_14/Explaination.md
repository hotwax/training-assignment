## Explaination:
### Operators: shift
* ### "shift":
    * ### transformation spec takes the original data structure and restructures it by shifting and rearranging the fields. It creates an "employees" field that contains an array of objects. Each object within the array includes the fields from the original data, as well as the "number" and "type" fields extracted from the "phone" field.
    * ### The second operation further restructures the data by assigning the values of the "home" and "work" fields within each "employees" object to the "homePhone" and "workPhone" fields in the transformed data structure, respectively.
