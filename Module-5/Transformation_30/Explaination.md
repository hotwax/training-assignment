## Explaination
### Operation:shift
 restructures the JSON data by mapping the "name" field as-is and reordering and combining the values of specified fields within the "office" field using the "shift" operation. The resulting output will have the transformed JSON structure with the modified element order and the "name" field at the same location as in the original JSON.
