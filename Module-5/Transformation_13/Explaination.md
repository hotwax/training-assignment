## Explaination:
### Operators: shift,remove
* ### "shift":
    transformation spec takes the original data structure and restructures it by creating an "employees" field that contains an array of objects. Each object within the array only includes the "id" field from the original data.
* ### "remove":
    The "id" field is then removed from each "employees" object in the transformed data structure.
