## Explaination:
### Operation:modify-overwrite-beta,shift
first we modifies the "currency" field within the "prices" field by concatenating values from other fields. Then, it uses the "shift" operation to restructure the JSON data and map the "value" field to the modified "currency" field. The resulting output will have the transformed JSON structure with modified "currency" values and rearranged fields as specified in the transformation spec.
