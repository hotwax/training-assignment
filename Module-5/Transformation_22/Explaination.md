## Explaination:
### Operations:shift

The "shift" operation maps the value of "rating.value" within the "restaurant" field to the "Restaurant Rating" field in the output JSON. It extracts the value of "rating.value" and assigns it to the "Restaurant Rating" field in the output. The use of "[#4]" indicates that the extracted value will be placed in an array at index 4.
