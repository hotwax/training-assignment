Approach:
To find the largest order taken by each salesperson on each date, we need to join the orders table with the salespeople table on the snum column.

and use the MAX function to get the largest order amount for each group.

Actual Output:
+---------+-------------+------------+

matches the condition: the "snum" value of the customer is the same as the "snum" value of the salesperson in the outer query, 
and the "rating" value of the customer is 300.
