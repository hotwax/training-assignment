Number of operations - 2
1. modify-overwrite-beta
2. shift

Explaintion -
We have to split fullName to first & last name and count no. of enteries in the phone_numbers.
We can use modify-overwrite-beta's split method to perform task 
then we will use split operation to organize and keep only the required fields.
Also we can use another way to do it by writting "* *"  it will split name with space.
And we will use $(0,1) and $(0,2) there to access it.
