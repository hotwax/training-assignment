Expected Output:-
first of all keys-value pairs with key 72,18,43,36 and 6 should be added.
number of collision should be 0
key-value pair 10-1000 should be added.
number of collision should be 3
key-value pair 5-5000 should be added.
number of collision should be 5
key-value pair 15-1500 should be added.
number of collision should be 7


My Output :-
Enter size of bucket

Expected Output:-
Above provided key-value pairs should be stored and value of key 49 should be updated from 490 to 10000.
HashMap should be printed when we select 4 from menu.
number of collisions should be 5. (updation of value of key 49 should not be counted as collision.)

Expected Output:-
key value pair with keys 50, 49, 51 should be stored.
after selecting 2(get) we should get the value of key 51 ie 510.
then we delete value for key 51 it should show value deleted successfully.
then we call get for key 51 and we should receive value=-1.
