Expected Output:-
first of all keys-value pairs with key 72,18,43,36 and 6 should be added.
number of collision should be 0
key-value pair 10-1000 should be added.
number of collision should be 1
key-value pair 5-5000 should be added.
number of collision should be 1
key-value pair 15-1500 should be added.
number of collision should be 1


My Output :-
Enter size of bucket
8
Enter size of HashMap

Expected Output:-
Above provided key-value pairs should be stored and value of key 49 should be updated from 490 to 10000.
HashMap should be printed when we select 4 from menu.
number of collisions should be 1. (updation of value of key 49 should not be counted as collision.)
