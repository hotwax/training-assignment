number of collision should be 0
key-value pair 5-5000 should be added.
number of collision should be 0
key-value pair 15-1500 should be added.
number of collision should be 0

Expected Output:-
key value pair with keys 50, 49, 51 should be stored.
after selecting 2(get) we should get the value of key 51 ie 510.
then we delete value for key 51 it should show value deleted successfully.
then we call get for key 51 and we should receive value=-1.
