## Number of operation 3
1. modify-overwrite-beta (1 times)
2. shift (1 times)
3. remove (1 times)


## Explanation:

1. The "modify-overwrite-beta" operation is used to modify and overwrite the values in the "hobbies" array. Each hobby object is modified to include additional properties such as "id" and "name" from the top-level object, as well as "hobby_level" and "hobby_name" from the corresponding hobby object.
2. The "shift" operation is used to restructure the JSON. The "hobbies" array is shifted to create a new array of objects with the property name "#1".
3. The "remove" operation is used to remove the "level" property from each object in the JSON.

* As a result, the JSON will be transformed to have the hobbies listed with additional properties and without the "level" property.
