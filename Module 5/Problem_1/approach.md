### Number of operations: 5
1. modify-overwrite-beta
2. shift
3. remove
### Approach
1. The modify-overwrite-beta is used in order to concatenate the firstName and the lastName and the complete address into a single string. Also the modify-overwrite-beta operation is used to create a key value pair that gives us the total of orders by using the divide and doubleSum functions.
2. The shift operation is then used in order to get the desired output in that particular order.
3. Finally the remove operation is used to remove all the temp variables that were created during the calculation of the total amount of orders.
