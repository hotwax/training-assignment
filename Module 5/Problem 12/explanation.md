### Explanation: 

The transformation involves following operations:

* `modify-overwrite-beta:` It concatenates the "firstName" and "lastName" fields to create a new "name" field within the "employee" object. It also concatenates the "street", "city", "state", and "zip" fields of the "address" object to create a new "address" field within the "employee" object.

* `shift operation:` Restructures the JSON, assigns the value of the "name" field to the root level of the output JSON, along with the "address" and renaming the list 'phones' to 'phoneNumbers.'
