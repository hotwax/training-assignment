### Explanation: 

The transformation involves following operations:

* `modify-overwrite-beta` overwrites the 'type' field to each "phone" object by concatenating the value of "type" field with "Phone" string.
* `shift:` restructures the JSON by mapping "id", "name", and "temp" fields to required level in employee array and maps the value of 'number' field to the the value of 'type' key, making it the key.
