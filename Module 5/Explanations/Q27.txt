In the corresponding transformation spec: 

Within each matched field, there are several transformations:
"Return Id" field is mapped to "@(1,returnId)" in the output.
The "@(1)" notation refers to the first index position in the input array.
"returnQuantity" field is computed using the "divide" function with parameters 1 and the value of "returnQuantity".
"Return Amount" field is computed using the "divide" function with parameters "returnPrice" and "returnQuantity".
"Return Total Amount" field is computed using the "doubleSum" function with parameters "Return Amount" and "returnTax".
The second operation is "remove" with the "spec" section specifying fields to be removed from the input JSON.
The third operation is "shift" with the "spec" section defining transformations on the input JSON.
"Return Id" field is mapped to the output field "[#2].&".
"Return Amount" field is mapped to the output field "[#2].&".
"Return Total Amount" field is mapped to the output field "[#2].&".
The "[#2]" notation refers to the current index position in the output array.
"country" field has conditional mappings based on its values:
If the value is "USA", the output field is "[#4].Country" with the value "#United States of America".
If the value is "CA", the output field is "[#4].Country" with the value "#Canada".
If the value is empty (""), the output field is "[#4].Country" with the value "#NA".
