In the corresponding transformation spec: 

The operation is "shift" with the "spec" section defining transformations on the "employees" field.
The empty string ("") is mapped to "@(1,name).@(1,level)[]".
The "@(1,name)" represents the value of the "name" field at the first level, which is the employee's name.
The "@(1,level)" represents the value of the "level" field at the first level, which is the skill level.
The "[]" notation appends the current skill object to an array under the employee's name and skill level.
The "@(2,name)" is mapped to "@(1,name).@(1,level)[]".
The "@(2,name)" represents the value of the "name" field at the second level, which is the skill name.
This mapping appends the current skill object to the same array as above, under the employee's name and skill level.
