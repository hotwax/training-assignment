In the corresponding transformation spec: 

The nested "address" field is further mapped to separate fields within the "address" object, including "street", "city", "state", and "zip".
The second operation is "modify-overwrite-beta" to modify and overwrite certain fields.
The "name" field is modified using the "concat" function to concatenate the "firstName" and "lastName" fields with a space in between.
Similarly, the "Address" field is also modified.
The third operation is "remove" to remove the "address" field from the JSON structure.
The fourth operation is "shift" to rearrange the transformed data.
