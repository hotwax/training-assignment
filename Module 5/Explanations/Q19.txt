In the corresponding transformation spec: 

For each product, there are two modifications:

The "number" field is modified using the "divide" function with arguments 1 and 2. It divides 1 by 2.
The "final" field is modified using the "divide" function. It divides the value of the "price" field by the value of the "number" field in the same product.
The second operation is "shift" with the "spec" section defining transformations on the "products" field.    
Within "products", there are two mappings:
"0" matches the product at index 0 in the array.
"*" matches all other products in the array.
