In the corresponding transformation spec: 

Within each matched field, there are several transformations:
"returnId" field is mapped to "@(1,Return Id)" in the output.
The "@(1)" notation refers to the first index position in the input array.
"inverse" field is computed using the "divide" function with parameters 1 and the value of "returnQuantity".
"Return Amount" field is computed using the "divide" function with parameters "returnPrice" and "inverse".
"Return Total Amount" field is computed using the "doubleSum" function with parameters "Return Amount" and "returnTax".
The second operation is "remove" with the "spec" section specifying fields to be removed from the input JSON.
The third operation is "shift" with the "spec" section defining transformations on the input JSON.
"returnId" field is mapped to the output field "[&1].Return Id".
"Return Amount" field is mapped to the output field "[&1].Return Amount".
"Return Total Amount" field is mapped to the output field "[&1].Return Total Amount".
The "[&1]" notation refers to the current index position in the output array.
