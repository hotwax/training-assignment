In the corresponding transformation spec: 

For each specific name, there are further mappings:
For "John Doe":
"@(2,name)" represents the name property at the second level and is mapped to 
"employees[&3].name".
"#1000" represents a specific value and is mapped to "employees[&3].bonus", likewise for other.
The second operation is "modify-overwrite-beta" to modify and overwrite the "bonus" field as an 
integer.
