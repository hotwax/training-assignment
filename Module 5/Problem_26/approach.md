### Approach
1. The modify-overwrite-beta operation is used along with the divide and doubleSum functions to calculate the product of the price and the quantity of the orders and then the tax is included in this to finally calculate the total return amount.
2. Finally, the remove operation is used to remove all the temporary variables that were made during the modify-overwrite-beta operation along with the pre-existing key-value pairs that were not required in the output json.
