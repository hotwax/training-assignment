### Explanation: 

The transformation involves following operations:

* `modify-overwrite-beta:`It calculates the "Return Amount" field by multiplying returnPrice and returnQuantity. and then a field named 'ReturnTotalAmount' is created by adding returnTax and returnAmount


* `shift:` It extracts the created fields from step 1 and the "returnId" field is renamed to "ReturnId", resulting in availibility of all three fields grouped in each object of list.
