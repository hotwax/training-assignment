### Number of operations: 2
1. modify-overwrite-beta
2. shift


### Approach
1. The modify-overwrite-beta operation is used to concatenate the value of the key id with the value of the currency key.
2. The second operation i.e. the shift operation is used to change the structure of the json to match the output json and to include only the required details.
