### Explanation: 

The transformation involves following operations:

* `modify-default-beta:`  It modifies the input object by adding a new field called "temp" to each price object within the "prices" array. The value of the "temp" field is generated by concatenating the "id" and "currency" fields with an underscore (_) in between.

* `shift` : It selects the "value" field within each "prices" array and maps it to the corresponding "temp" field value generated in the previous step.
