### Explanation: 

The transformation involves following operations:

* `shift:` It shifts the values of the "returnId" field to the corresponding index in the output array, and it retrieves the "amount" values from the "returnItemAdjustments" array and assigns them to the "returnTax" array containig the price values of each items

* `modify-overwrite-beta:` it modifies the "returnTax" field in each object by calculating the sum of all "returnTax" values for each "returnId". The resulting sum is assigned back to the "returnTax" field.
