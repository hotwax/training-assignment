## Number Of Operation 2
1. modify-default-beta (1 times)
2. shift (1 times)

## Explanation :
* The "modify-default-beta" operation is used to add a temporary property called "temp" to each item's prices array. The value of "temp" is generated by concatenating the item's "id" and the "currency" value of each price.
* The "shift" operation is used to restructure the JSON by mapping the "@value" of each price to the corresponding "@temp" property.
* As a result, the JSON will be transformed to have the "id_currency" format for each price value under the "items" array.
