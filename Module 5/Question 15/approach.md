## Explanation:

* It shifts the values of the "orders" array under each "customerId" and creates a new "orders" array at the top level.

* It shifts all the remaining key-value pairs under the top-level asterisk, which is the current object, and renames it as "customers".

* It restructures the "customers" object to have nested "orders" arrays with their respective properties, and assigns the total order price to the "totalAmount" property.

* It modifies the "customers" object by calculating the sum of "totalAmount" for each customer and assigns their respective "id". It also modifies the first customer's "name" to "John Doe" and the second customer's "name" to "Jane Doe".

* It removes the "customerId" property from all orders.
It sorts the "customers" array alphabetically based on the customer's name.
