/*
The serialization at runtime associates with each serializable class a version number called a serialVersionUID,
which is used during deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serialized object have loaded classes
for that object that are compatible with respect to serialization.
It is because SerialVersionUID is used to ensure that during deserialization the same class (that was used during 
serialize process) is loaded.

JVM will match the serialVersionUID of current .class file and the serialized file if they both don't match
then JVM will throw an InvalidClassException
