we want to add 500 at 0th index, 600 at 1st index, 700 at 2nd index and so on..
Firstly I have stored indexes of every element of employee list in temp key.
Then in second operation, I have stored I have multiplied that temp with 100 and added (temp*100+500) into salary for every map inside list.
Then finally I have removed extra temporary variables required for calculations.
