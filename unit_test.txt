Tables involved- customers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



3) Find the largest order taken by each salesperson on each date. 

Approach- Use GROUP BY with odate, snum so that orders having same snum and odate get grouped together and MAX(amt) to get maximum 
of multiple amounts of same day by a salesperson.

Expected output- If a salesperson has multiple orders on a single day then we have to select the maximum order 
for that day. Show names, numbers of salespeople, date of order and maximum order for that day. 

Tables involved- orders, salespeople
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

salesperson. Then filter with HAVING to get salespeople having COUNT of customers > 1. Also, use inner join with
salespeople table on snum to get salespeople's names.

Expected output- A salesperson can have multiple customers. We have to select numbers and names of
those with more than one customer.   

Tables involved- customers, salespeople
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



8) Count the orders of each of the salespeople and output the results in descending order. 

Approach- Use GROUP BY on snum to group salespeople and COUNT on onum or * to count number of orders. Then use
ORDER BY and DESC to sort the result in descending order.

Expected output- names, numbers and count of orders of each salesperson. 

Tables involved- orders, salespeople
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



9) List the customer table if and only if one or more of the customers in the Customer table are located in SanJose.

whether the subquery table exists, if yes then select * from customers table.

Expected output- If number of customers located in SanJose is >= 1, then show customers table. So the output will be
the customers table or an empty set. 

Tables involved- customers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



10) Match salespeople to customers according to what city they live in. 

Approach- Use inner join on city in salespeople and customers tables to get names of salespeople and customers 
and their matched city respectively.

amount sum > (2000+ maximum amount in orders table (subquery)).  

Expected output- amount sum per day and date of only those orders having their sum >  (2000+ maximum amount) from orders table. 
If there are no such sums of the day then we will get an empty set.

Tables involved- orders
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



16) Select all orders that had amounts that were greater than at least one of the orders from October 6. 

Approach- We can use ANY to check whether the amount of an order is > (one of the orders from October 6). But ANY will
check every amount one by one and stop as soon as it finds a smaller amount. 
So instead of selecting all orders from October 6, we would select only the minimum order. If the amount of an order is 
less than the minimum amount then surely its going to be lesser than all other bigger amounts. And use a subquery to get
min amount on October 6.

Expected output- numbers and amount of all such orders whose amount is > (one of the orders from October 6) .

of multiple amounts of same day by a salesperson and then filter these records with HAVING on max amount >= 3000. Also, use 
INNER JOIN on snum to get names of salespeople from salespeople table.

Expected output- If a salesperson has multiple orders on a single day then we have to select the maximum order 
for that day if is >= 3000. Show names, numbers of salespeople, date of order and maximum order for that day.

the smaller amounts of customers in SanJose, so don't select it. And if it is smaller then select it. 
We are going to use Max on amount instead of ANY beacuse ANY will continue to find a match until a greater amount is 
found. 

Expected output- numbers and amount of orders with their amount < any amount for a customer in SanJose. 

Tables involved- orders, customers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



39) Find all orders with above-average amounts for their customers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



48) Write a query that selects all the customers whose ratings are equal to or greater than ANY(in the SQL sense) of ‘Serres’. 

Approach- Instead of using ANY, use MIN on ratings of Serres customers (200,300) because ANY will keep checking until the desired
rating is found. But if any rating is greater than minimum rating of Serres customers, include it else don't because obviously its 
going to be smaller than all other ratings. So use a subquery to get minimum rating of Serres customers and then check with WHERE. 

Expected outcome- customers names and numbers whose ratings are equal to or greater than minimum ratings of Serres customers(200).

Tables involved- customers, salespeople
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

50) Find only those customers whose ratings are higher than every customer in Rome. 

Approach- To check rating from every customer, either we can use ALL or select maximum rating of customers living in Rome. Then if a 
rating is greater than this maximum rating this means it is greater than all other ratings of customers living in Rome so include it
else we have found this one maximum rating which is greater than the given rating so don't include it. 

Expected outcome- names and numbers of customers whose ratings are higher than every customer in Rome(100,200). 

Tables involved- customers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



51) Write a query on the Customers table whose output will exclude all customers with a rating&lt;= 100.00, unless they are located in Rome.

rating≠100 and city=rome -  passed, since his rating is not 100.
rating=100 and city=rome - passed, since he lives in Rome.
rating=100 and city≠rome - not passed, since his rating is 100 and he doesn't live in Rome also.

for these all, we can use OR with these conditions- rating≠100, city='Rome'

Expected outcome- names, cities and ratings of customers either not having 100 rating or living in rome.

NULL. Join these two with AND to select an amount only if both conditions hold true. 

Expected outcome- non zero and non null amount and numbers of orders.

Tables involved- orders
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



55) Produce all combinations of salespeople and customer names such that the former precedes the latter alphabetically, and the latter has a rating of less than 200.

So, use AND with these conditions- sname<cname, rating<200. 

Expected outcome- names of salespeople and customers having salesperson's name alphabetically smaller 
than customer's name and customer's rating < 200

Tables involved- customers, salespeople
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
