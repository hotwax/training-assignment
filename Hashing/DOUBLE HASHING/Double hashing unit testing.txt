1.Insertion Test Cases

Test Case 1: Insert a new key-value pair in the empty hash table
Input: key = 5, value = 10
Output: No output (successful insertion)


Test Case 2: Insert a new key-value pair in the non-empty hash table
Input: key = 15, value = 20
Output: No output (successful insertion)


Test Case 3: Insert a new key-value pair in the full hash table
Input: key = 25, value = 30
Output: "HashMap is Full"

Test Case 4: Insert a duplicate key in the hash table
Input: key = 5, value = 15
Output: No output (value for existing key is updated)



2.Deletion Test Cases

Test Case 1: Delete a key that exists in the hash table
Input: key = 15
Output: "Operation Successful"

Test Case 2: Delete a key that does not exist in the hash table
Input: key = 35
Output: "Key Not found"

Test Case 3: Delete a key from an empty hash table
Input: key = 10
Output: "Key Not found"



3.Search Test Cases

Test Case 1: Search a key that exists in the hash table
Input: key = 5
Output: "Key Found and its Value is 15"

Test Case 2: Search a key that does not exist in the hash table
Input: key = 35
Output: "Key Not found"

Test Case 3: Search a key from an empty hash table
Input: key = 10
Output: "Key Not found"
