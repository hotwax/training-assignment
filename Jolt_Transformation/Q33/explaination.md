### Number of Operations: 2

1. modify-overwrite-beta
2. shift

### Explanation:

1. The first operation is a "modify-overwrite-beta" operation. It modifies the "hobbies" object by iterating through its elements. It assigns the value of "id" from the input data to a new key called "id" at the same level, and assigns the value of "name" from the input data to a new key called "name1" at the same level.

2. The second operation is a "shift" operation. It extracts the modified values from the "hobbies" object. It assigns the value of "id" to a new key called "hobby_name" at the same level, assigns the value of "name" to a new key called "name" at the same level, and assigns the value of "level" to a new key called "hobby_level" at the same level. The resulting JSON structure will have keys named "hobby_name", "name", and "hobby_level" containing the corresponding values from the input data.
