### Number of Operations: 2

1. shift,
2. shift

### Explanation

1. The first shift operation iterates through the "data" object and assigns the values to new keys using the "x" index as the key name.

2. The second shift operation iterates through the resulting JSON from the first operation and assigns the "value" field under each key, using the "y" index as the key name at a nested level. The resulting JSON structure will have keys named "x" and "y" containing the corresponding values from the input data.
