1. modify-overwrite-beta
2. shift

### Explanation
1. This operation is used to concatenates the values of the "id" and "currency" fields within the nested "prices" map and assigns the concatenated value to a new "currency" field within the same map. This concatenation is performed for all nested "prices" map within each item in the "items" list.

2. This operation is used to maps the values of the "currency" field within the nested "prices" map to a new map. The resulting map contains a flattened structure with each "currency" value extracted from the original nested "prices" map.
