1. This operation modifies the "Student" list  by adding two new fields to each student. It splits the value of the "email" field at the "@" symbol using the "split" function, and assigns the resulting array to the "email" field. It also assigns the last element of the "email" array to the "domain" field.

2. This operation restructures the "Student" list by extracting specific fields and assigning them to new field names.
