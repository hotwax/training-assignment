Menu looks like :

===========================
Your Directed Graph --
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0


Enter 1 for Add Edge operation
Enter 2 for Delete Edge operation
Enter 3 for BFS Traversal operation
Enter 4 for DFS Traversal operation
Enter 5 to exit
===========================

1) Test cases asking for matrix dimensions

Input:
Enter the no. of nodes.4

Output:
Your Directed Graph --
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0


2) Test case for adding an edge:

Input:
1

Enter the Node 1 : 2

Enter the node2 : 1

Output: 
Your Directed Graph --
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0

3) Test case for deleting an Edge:

Input:
2

Enter the Node 1 : 2

Enter the node2 : 1

Output:
Your Directed Graph --
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0

4) Test case for traversing the graph using DFS:

Input:
4

Output:
DFS Traversal - 0 1 2 3

5) Test case if we give less vertex and try to store more data

Expected and actual ouput:
Invalid node index!

6) Test case if we give more vertex and try to store less data

Expected and actual ouput:
Invalid node index!

7) Test case for exiting the program:

Input:
5

Output:
Terminated the program
