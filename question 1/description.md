In first modify-overwrite-beta operation we are iterating to very map of items list and storing quantity * price as singleTotalItem
In second operation I am puting items into items and temp Items so, that we can perform operations on tempItems and our original items list remains as it is.
In third operation we are storing totalSingleItem of every elemt of itemsTemp into priceList.
In third operation we are doing the doubleSum of elemts of priceList and also doubling the price value.
finally removing unnecessary data which we dont want in out output JSON using remove operation.
