Process to serialize and deserialize a Student object with different scenarios:

1.Serialization:
 - Create a Student object with DOB as a String type.
 - And serialize the Student object in to output1.ser and output2.ser. 

2.Deserialization:
 - Deserialize output1.ser and output2.ser.

3.Change DOB type to Date and serialize output2.ser:
 - Modify the Student class to change the DOB field from a String to a Date type.
 - Create a Student object with DOB as a Date type.
 - And serialize the Student object in to output2.ser.

4.Deserialization of output2.ser:
 - Deserialize output2.ser.

5.Handle invalidClass exception for output1.ser:
 - When deserializing output1.ser, if it gives an invalidClass exception, add a serialVersionUID 
   field to the Student class to maintain backward compatibility with previously serialized 
   objects.

6.Handle classcast exception for output1.ser:
 - When deserializing output1.ser after handling the invalidClass exception, if it gives a classcast exception, 
   change the type of the DOB field to Object to allow for different types to be stored in the same field.

7.Successful deserialization:
 - Verify that output1.ser and output2.ser can be deserialized successfully without exceptions.
